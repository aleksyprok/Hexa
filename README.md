# Hexa
This code allows the data-driven simulation of an active regionâ€™s coronal magnetic field to be carried out using normal-component magnetograms as a lower boundary condi- tion. Hexa utilises the magnetofrictional method to produce a series of time-evolving quasi-static non-linear force-free (NLFF) equilibria. The coronal evolution is driven by the evolution of the photospheric magnetic field, as prescribed from magnetogram observations. Hexa is a parallel code (parallelisation implemented by MPI) and is designed to be run on a supercomputer, however low resolution runs can be carried out on a desktop machine relatively quickly (utilising 2 or 4 cores).
